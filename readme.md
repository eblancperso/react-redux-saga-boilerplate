# ðŸ”¥ React + Redux + Saga boilerplate ðŸ”¥

## What this repo contains
A (really humble) minimal react application built using create-react-app CLI with redux and saga middleware. This build is not production ready and is meant as a reference for beginners.

> You will need to install [Redux DevTools for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) in order to run this app.

## Packages
- React: 16.2.0
- Redux: 3.7.2
- Redux-saga: 0.16.0
- Axios: 0.17.1

## Features
Simple sign in form that accepts an email and a password. Once the submit button is pressed, a call is made to public API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com and the name of a user is displayed. This is meant to show a complete simple flow using redux and saga.

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eblancperso/react-redux-saga-boilerplate.git
npm install
npm start
```
